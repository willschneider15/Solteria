# Getting Started

## Introduction

eduScan is a platform created by students, for students, that provides the resources they need to thrive in the blockchain industry. Our networking hub offers web3 information, including upcoming events and seminars, to help newcomers and experienced developers sharpen blockchain development.

We work closely with major university clubs to provide students with access to even more resources. Our headless content management system allows clubs to share information about upcoming events and opportunities within the blockchain industry.

We've also built the world's first networking platform that allows users to build a social profile on the Solana blockchain. You can now network with ease, communicate with your peers and professionals, and showcase your skills and expertise in this exciting new space.
