# What are xNFTs?

Developed by Coral, the company that is building [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) and [backpack.](https://www.backpack.app/)

xNFT (executable NFTs) is the new standard for crypto platforms integrated in the backpack wallet. It essentially allows anyone to build and run native crypto platforms directly on their wallet.

This novel idea has many benefits such as eliminating the need of remembering & bookmarking the urls to your favorite crypto platform and instead you can download individual platforms as apps and run it at your convenience directly on the backpack wallet.
