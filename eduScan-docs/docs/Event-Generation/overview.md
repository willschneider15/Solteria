# Overview

For the headless content management system (CMS), eduScan opted to using Sanity. Sanity provides a powerful set of tools for managing and delivering content across multiple channels. We used a flexible schema that allows university blockchain club leaders to easily create and manage content types. We have provided a real-time collaboration environment that enables blockchain clubs to connect and join upcoming events.

Sanity's integration with JavaScript is seamless, making it easy for developers to get started with the CMS and begin building applications right away. The documentation provided by Sanity is comprehensive, providing detailed information on how to get started with the CMS, as well as how to use its powerful set of tools to create dynamic and engaging content.
