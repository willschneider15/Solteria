# Navigating Sanity Studio

## Getting Started

**If you are a university blockchain club leader and wish to be onboarded to our limited access content management system, please contact us through our **[eduScan Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3vKJjMnFXt).

1. Once you’ve gained access to our system, you will be able to post blockchain related content like upcoming events, seminars and workshops. The content can be hosted by your university or any blockchain related companies that you’ve collaborated with. As seen below, these are the cards that will be generated for every post that you create using our CMS.

2. After logging into **[cms.eduscan.xyz](http://cms.eduscan.xyz/)** with your login credentials, you will be directed to Sanity Studio. Here, you can enter the details of your upcoming events and seminars. To create a post, you first need to create an author for your school and/or blockchain club. The process is straightforward and can be completed in the "create author" tab:
   - Enter your desired username.
   - Upload an image of your school and/or blockchain club.
   - Click the "generate" button for the slug field.
   - Enter a general introduction to your school or blockchain club in the "Bio" field.

Once you have created your author, you can start creating posts for your upcoming events and seminars.

3. Once you have successfully created an author, you can start posting your desired content. Each post on our system requires certain fields to be filled out on a short form, including the title, start date, and event poster. To access the form, click on the "post" tab, where you will be introduced to various posts that have previously been posted on the eduScan website.

To create a new post, simply click on the "create post" icon, and a template will be generated for you to enter your event's information. Below is an example of a post template that has been filled out for one of our previous events:

After inputting the the required fields, you can scroll down and enter main image, event categories (event, workshop, panel, etc.), and a short blurb about the event. Additionally, you can provide more details about your event in the body field.

4. And you are done! Once you have inputted all the necessary information about your event into the template, simply click "publish." Your event will dynamically generate on eduScan within 15-20 seconds. Once you see the card appear on our site, you can click on "More info" within the card to access the event page. If you'd like to share the event with your peers, simply share the link to the event page.
