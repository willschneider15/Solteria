## Project Overview
EduScan is a networking platform and aggregator of blockchain information catered to students. The emergence of blockchain technology and its ongoing integration into everyday life has resulted in communities and information that are very compartmentalized. EduScan aims to change this by bringing universities, students, blockchain clubs and communities together on one cohesive platform.
